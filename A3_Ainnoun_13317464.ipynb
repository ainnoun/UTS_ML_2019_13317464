        "The rapid growth of travel and tourism sector has contributed to the economic sector. According to UNWTO (United Nation World Tourism Organisation) (2019), around 1.8 billion international tourist arrival is predicted by 2030. The largest number should be taken into account as tourism sector is a key driver for social-economic progress. World Economic Forum (WEF) (2019) has published the travel and tourism competitiveness index (TTCI) measuring factors in the travel and tourism sector of 140 countries. TTCI is derived from the measurement of relevant factors (14 pillars including 90 indicators) which relates to tourism sectors of individual country. TTCI is generates to ensure the competitiveness meet the demands. It provides reliable values for government and other stakeholders to acknowledge the emerging trends and anticipate the risks in the tourism sector. Stakeholders can use the generated unique insights to develop tourism areas and enhance industry competitiveness. By driving the competitiveness, they adapt the policies, practices, and investment decision from other countries to be implemented in order to satisfy the tourism demands as well improve the strategy and accurate planning. Even though the result of travel and tourism competitiveness is published every two years, it is possible to be conducted annually. It might require more resources and robust method to analyse the data."

The TTCI is derived from an arithmetic mean from the four component sub-indexes with each pillar is calculated as an un-weighted average of the individual indicator. Afterwards the data indicators are normalized to a 1 to 7 scale to align them with survey result. Other researches have been conducted on evaluating the ranking of every country using diverse machine learning methods to obtain trustworthiness. Considering diverse and rapid changes of the indicators every year, it might be possible to adopt neural network method to perform better. Hence, this project will evaluate the performance of the neural network method using the TTCI dataset."

        "A neural network (NN) method consists of given several inputs, output, and hidden layer located between input and output with responsibility transform and learn the mapping between both layers (Canuma, 2019). The approach of own learning is to map its input to obtain targets. It captures the more complex relationships rather than linear relationships, handle noisy, and suitable for modelling, classification, prediction. In this case, we will implement multi-layer perceptron (MLP) which is a class of the most common neural network architecture. It is also suitable for classification and regression prediction problems. Regarding its effectiveness, we will implement this method to analyze the value of each indicator, then evaluate its performance. MLP use a non-linear function in the hidden and output layers to allow the network to identify non-linear relationships in inputs. "

He concluded that DEA generated better performance among them which is more relevant to the ranking. Apart from evaluating the ranking, we focus on identifying and analysing indicators using MLP to generate classification in value 1 to 7 for each pillar. Considering varied indicators and the relationships between the indicators affecting several pillars (14 pillars with 90 indicators), I proposed the neural network method using MLP to classify each pillar in the range 1 to 7 based on the indicators in order to generate the accuracy. After building the model, it will be evaluated and generated the accuracy."
